              nematodes of the genus Mansonella. The prevalence and health

              control programmes targeting this neglected tropical disease.
              Mansonellosis is prevalent in certain regions of Colombia, and
              while infection is often thought to be asymptomatic it may be
              associated with underrecognized clinical manifestations. In this
              study, we analyzed biobanked specimens from 905 patients
              participating in a febrile syndrome surveillance program in
              Colombia for evidence of Mansonella ozzardi infection,
              identifying four confirmed cases. While there have been prior
              reports on the incidence of mansonellosis in Colombia, this is
              the first report to our knowledge describing M. ozzardi
              microfilariae occurring in febrile patients in the country.
              Additional studies are needed to better understand the clinical
              consequences of mansonellosis within the complex tropical
              environment of Colombia, which is endemic for numerous other

              needed in the event of emerging praziquantel resistance or
              treatment failure. One promising lead that has shown efficacy in
              animal models and a human clinical trial is the benzodiazepine
              meclonazepam, discovered by Roche in the 1970's. Meclonazepam was
              not brought to market because of dose-limiting sedative side
              effects. However, the human target of meclonazepam that causes
              sedation (GABAARs) are not orthologous to the parasite targets
              that cause worm death. Therefore, we were interested in whether
              the structure of meclonazepam could be modified to produce
              antiparasitic benzodiazepines that do not cause host sedation. We
              synthesized 18 meclonazepam derivatives with modifications at
              different positions on the benzodiazepine ring system and tested
              them for in vitro antiparasitic activity. This identified five
              compounds that progressed to in vivo screening in a murine model,
              two of which cured parasite infections with comparable potency to
              meclonazepam. When these two compounds were administered to mice
              that were run on the rotarod test, both were less sedating than
              meclonazepam. These findings demonstrate the proof of concept
              that meclonazepam analogs can be designed with an improved
              therapeutic index, and point to the C3 position of the
              benzodiazepine ring system as a logical site for further

              the Amazon River and its tributaries near Leticia, Colombia.
              Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays on

              Mansonella ozzardi infection (∼40\%) compared to blood smear

              there are growing efforts to better understand mechanisms of
              anthelmintic resistance in human and animal populations, it is
              unclear how resistance mechanisms that alter susceptibility to
              one drug affect the interactions and efficacy of drugs used in
              combination. Mutations that alter drug permeability across
              primary nematode barriers have been identified as potential
              resistance mechanisms using the model nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans . We leveraged high-throughput assays in this model
              system to measure altered anthelmintic susceptibility in response
              to genetic perturbations of potential cuticular, amphidial, and
              alimentary routes of drug entry. Mutations in genes associated
              with these tissue barriers differentially altered susceptibility

              benzimidazoles, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists) as

  abstract = "A promising candidate for arbovirus control and prevention relies
              on replacing arbovirus-susceptible Aedes aegypti populations with
              mosquitoes that have been colonized by the intracellular
              bacterium Wolbachia and thus have a reduced capacity to transmit
              arboviruses. This reduced capacity to transmit arboviruses is
              mediated through a phenomenon referred to as pathogen blocking.
              Pathogen blocking has primarily been proposed as a tool to
              control dengue virus (DENV) transmission, however it works
              against a range of viruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV). Despite
              years of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen
              blocking still need to be better understood. Here, we used
              RNA-seq to characterize mosquito gene transcription dynamics in
              Ae. aegypti infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia that are
              being released by the World Mosquito Program in Medell{\'\i}n,
              Colombia. Comparative analyses using ZIKV-infected, uninfected
              tissues, and mosquitoes without Wolbachia revealed that the
              influence of wMel on mosquito gene transcription is
              multifactorial. Importantly, because Wolbachia limits, but does
              not completely prevent, replication of ZIKV and other viruses in
              coinfected mosquitoes, there is a possibility that these viruses
              could evolve resistance to pathogen blocking. Therefore, to
              understand the influence of Wolbachia on within-host ZIKV
              evolution, we characterized the genetic diversity of molecularly
              barcoded ZIKV virus populations replicating in Wolbachia-infected
              mosquitoes and found that within-host ZIKV evolution was subject
              to weak purifying selection and, unexpectedly, loose anatomical
              bottlenecks in the presence and absence of Wolbachia. Together,
              these findings suggest that there is no clear transcriptional
              profile associated with Wolbachia-mediated ZIKV restriction, and
              that there is no evidence for ZIKV escape from this restriction

              nematode sensory assays are performed by tallying observations of
              worm behavior on two-dimensional planes using agarose plates.
              These assays have been successful in the study of volatile

              water-soluble gustation or parasitic nematodes without a

              tedious, often limited to the manipulation of a single individual
              at a time. We have designed a nematode sensory assay using a
              microfluidics device that allows for the study of gustation in a
              96-well, three-dimensional environment. This device is suited for
              free-living worms and parasitic worms that spend their lives in

              foundations for many sensory modalities in nematodes. However,
              these classical assays are poorly suited for translational
              movement of many parasitic nematodes and the sensation of
              water-soluble molecules (gustation). We have designed a device
              for high-throughput nematode sensory assays in a gel matrix. This
              'gustatory microplate' is amenable to several species and reveals
              novel responses by free-living and parasitic nematodes to cues

              Anthelmintic drug resistance is widespread among parasites of
              livestock and many nematode parasites of humans lack effective
              treatments. Here, we present a nitrophenyl-piperazine scaffold

              a target recognized by commercial animal and crop health groups
              as a viable anthelmintic target. We demonstrate that it is

              activity whilst lowering their affinity to the mammalian VAChT
              10-fold. We also show that Nemacol enhances the ability of the

  abstract = "Filarial parasitic nematodes (Filarioidea) cause substantial
              disease burden to humans and animals around the world. Recently
              there has been a coordinated global effort to generate, annotate,
              and curate genomic data from nematode species of medical and
              veterinary importance. This has resulted in two chromosome-level
              assemblies (Brugia malayi and Onchocerca volvulus) and 11
              additional draft genomes from Filarioidea. These reference
              assemblies facilitate comparative genomics to explore basic
              helminth biology and prioritize new drug and vaccine targets.
              While the continual improvement of genome contiguity and
              completeness advances these goals, experimental functional
              annotation of genes is often hindered by poor gene models.
              Short-read RNA sequencing data and expressed sequence tags, in
              cooperation with ab initio prediction algorithms, are employed
              for gene prediction, but these can result in missing
              clade-specific genes, fragmented models, imperfect mapping of
              gene ends, and lack of isoform resolution. Long-read RNA
              sequencing can overcome these drawbacks and greatly improve gene
              model quality. Here, we present Iso-Seq data for B. malayi and
              Dirofilaria immitis, etiological agents of lymphatic filariasis
              and canine heartworm disease, respectively. These data cover
              approximately half of the known coding genomes and substantially
              improve gene models by extending untranslated regions, cataloging
              novel splice junctions from novel isoforms, and correcting
              mispredicted junctions. Furthermore, we validated computationally
              predicted operons, manually curated new operons, and merged
              fragmented gene models. We carried out analyses of poly(A) tails
              in both species, leading to the identification of non-canonical
              poly(A) signals. Finally, we prioritized and assessed known and
              putative anthelmintic targets, correcting or validating gene
              models for molecular cloning and target-based anthelmintic
              screening efforts. Overall, these data significantly improve the
              catalog of gene models for two important parasites, and they

              for ongoing improvement of parasitic nematode genome assemblies.",

              infections in response to the growing threat of drug resistance.
              G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are established drug targets
              in human medicine but remain unexploited as anthelmintic
              substrates despite their important roles in nematode

              limited helminth genetic toolkit and difficulties establishing
              functional heterologous expression. In an effort to address some
              of these challenges, we profile the function and pharmacology of
              muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the human parasite Brugia
              malayi, an etiological agent of human lymphatic filariasis. While
              acetylcholine-gated ion channels are intensely studied as targets
              of existing anthelmintics, comparatively little is known about
              metabotropic receptor contributions to parasite cholinergic
              signaling. Using multivariate phenotypic assays in microfilariae
              and adults, we show that nicotinic and muscarinic compounds
              disparately affect parasite fitness traits. We identify a
              putative G protein-linked acetylcholine receptor of B. malayi
              (Bma-GAR-3) that is highly expressed across intramammalian life
              stages and adapt spatial RNA in situ hybridization to map
              receptor transcripts to critical parasite tissues.
              Tissue-specific expression of Bma-gar-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans

              deorphanization and pharmacological profiling in a nematode
              physiological context. Finally, we developed an image-based
              feeding assay as a reporter of pharyngeal activity to facilitate
              GPCR screening in parasitized strains. We expect that these
              receptor characterization approaches and improved knowledge of
              GARs as putative drug targets will further advance the study of

              Ivermectin is well known to be inactive against flatworms.
              However, the structure-activity relationship of macrocyclic
              lactones may vary across phyla, and it is entirely possible other
              members of this drug class do in fact show antiparasitic activity
              on flatworms. For example, there are several reports hinting at
              the anti-schistosomal activity of doramectin and moxidectin. To
              explore this class further, we developed an automated imaging
              assay combined with measurement of lactate levels from worm
              media. This assay was applied to the screening of 21 macrocyclic
              lactones (avermectins, milbemycins, and others such as spinosyns)
              against adult schistosomes. These in vitro assays identified
              several macrocyclic lactones (emamectin, milbemycin oxime, and
              the moxidectin metabolite 23-ketonemadectin) that caused
              contractile paralysis and lack of lactate production. Several of
              these were also active against miracidia, which infect the snail
              intermediate host. Hits prioritized from these in vitro assays
              were administered to mice harboring patent schistosome
              infections. However, no reduction in worm burden was observed.
              Nevertheless, these data show the utility of a multiplexed in
              vitro screening platform to quantitatively assess drug action and
              exclude inactive compounds from a chemical series before
              proceeding to in vivo studies. While the prototypical macrocyclic
              lactone ivermectin displays minimal activity against adult
              Schistosoma mansoni, this family of compounds does contain
              schistocidal compounds which may serve as a starting point for

              require concomitant development of analytical software capable of
              handling large datasets and generating relevant phenotypic
              measurements. Several tools have been developed to analyze drug
              response phenotypes in parasitic and free-living worms, but these
              are siloed and often limited to specific instrumentation, worm
              species, and single phenotypes. No unified tool exists to analyze
              diverse high-content phenotypic imaging data of worms and provide
              a platform for future extensibility. We have developed wrmXpress,
              a unified framework for analyzing a variety of phenotypes matched
              to high-content experimental assays of free-living and parasitic
              nematodes and flatworms. We demonstrate its utility for analyzing
              a suite of phenotypes, including motility, development/size,
              fecundity, and feeding, and establish the package as a platform
              upon which to build future custom phenotypic modules. We show
              that wrmXpress can serve as an analytical workhorse for
              anthelmintic screening efforts across schistosomes, filarial

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The aquatic pulmonate snail Biomphalaria glabrata is
              a significant vector and laboratory host for the parasitic
              flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, an etiological agent for the
              neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Much is known
              regarding the host-parasite interactions of these two organisms,
              and the B. glabrata embryonic (Bge) cell line has been an
              invaluable resource in these studies. The B. glabrata BB02 genome
              sequence was recently released, but nothing is known of the
              sequence variation between this reference and the Bge cell
              genome, which has likely accumulated substantial genetic
              variation in the ~50 years since its isolation. RESULTS: Here, we
              report the genome sequence of our laboratory subculture of the
              Bge cell line (designated Bge3), which we mapped to the B.
              glabrata BB02 reference genome. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
              were predicted and focus was given to those SNVs that are most
              likely to affect the structure or expression of protein-coding
              genes. Furthermore, we have highlighted and validated high-impact
              SNVs in genes that have often been studied using Bge cells as an
              in vitro model, and other genes that may have contributed to the
              immortalization of this cell line. We also resolved
              representative karyotypes for the Bge3 subculture, which revealed
              a mixed population exhibiting substantial aneuploidy, in line
              with previous reports from other Bge subcultures. CONCLUSIONS:
              The Bge3 genome differs from the B. glabrata BB02 reference
              genome in both sequence and structure, and these are likely to
              have significant biological effects. The availability of the Bge3
              genome sequence, and an awareness of genomic differences with B.
              glabrata, will inform the design of experiments to understand
              gene function in this unique in vitro snail cell model.
              Additionally, this resource will aid in the development of new
              technologies and molecular approaches that promise to reveal more

              filarial nematodes secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) and that
              their cargo has immunomodulatory properties. Here we investigate
              the effects of IVM and other anti-filarial drugs on parasitic

              at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Protein secretion was
              inhibited by IVM in the microfilariae stage, but not in any other

              secretion of immunomodulatory EVs by parasitic nematodes could

               Lymphatic Filariasis. The capability of B. malayi and other
               parasitic nematodes to modulate host biology is recognized but
               the mechanisms by which such manipulation occurs are obscure. An
               emerging paradigm is the release of parasite-derived
               extracellular vesicles (EV) containing bioactive proteins and
               small RNA species that allow secretion of parasite effector
               molecules and their potential trafficking to host tissues. We
               have previously described EV release from the infectious L3
               stage B. malayi and here we profile vesicle release across all
               intra-mammalian life cycle stages (microfilariae, L3, L4, adult
               male and female worms). Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis was used
               to quantify and size EVs revealing discrete vesicle populations
               and indicating a secretory process that is conserved across the
               life cycle. Brugia EVs are internalized by murine macrophages
               with no preference for life stage suggesting a uniform mechanism
               for effector molecule trafficking. Further, the use of chemical
               uptake inhibitors suggests all life stage EVs are internalized
               by phagocytosis. Proteomic profiling of adult male and female
               EVs using nano-scale LC-MS/MS described quantitative and

               stages. Further this drug effect was also observed in the

               immitis but not in an ivermectin-unresponsive field isolate of

              impose a massive hindrance to progress in the developing world.
              While basic research on parasitic flatworms (platyhelminths)
              continues to expand, researchers have yet to broadly adopt a
              free-living model to complement the study of these important
              parasites. METHODS: We report the high-coverage sequencing
              (RNA-Seq) and assembly of the transcriptome of the planarian
              Girardia tigrina across a set of dynamic conditions. The assembly
              was annotated and extensive orthology analysis was used to seed a
              pipeline for the rational prioritization and validation of
              putative anthelmintic targets. A small number of targets
              conserved between parasitic and free-living flatworms were
              comparatively interrogated. RESULTS: 240 million paired-end reads
              were assembled de novo to produce a strictly filtered predicted
              proteome consisting of over 22,000 proteins. Gene Ontology
              annotations were extended to 16,467 proteins. 2,693 sequences
              were identified in orthology groups spanning flukes, tapeworms
              and planaria, with 441 highlighted as belonging to druggable
              protein families. Chemical inhibitors were used on three targets
              in pharmacological screens using both planaria and schistosomula,
              revealing distinct motility phenotypes that were shown to
              correlate with planarian RNAi phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This work
              provides the first comprehensive and annotated sequence resource
              for the model planarian G. tigrina, alongside a prioritized list
              of candidate drug targets conserved among parasitic and
              free-living flatworms. As proof of principle, we show that a
              simple RNAi and pharmacology pipeline in the more convenient
              planarian model system can inform parasite biology and serve as
              an efficient screening tool for the identification of lucrative
              anthelmintic targets.",

              million people at risk in endemic areas. Although mass drug
              administration is a cost-effective approach to reduce occurrence,

              the parasites' intermediate snail hosts are a crucial part of the
              integrated strategy required to move toward disease elimination.
              The recent revolution in gene drive technology naturally leads to
              questions about whether gene drives could be used to efficiently
              spread schistosome resistance traits in a population of snails
              and whether gene drives have the potential to contribute to
              reduced disease transmission in the long run. Responsible
              implementation of gene drives will require solutions to complex
              challenges spanning multiple disciplines, from biology to policy.

              level of resistance conferred by the gene drive, how fast gene
              drives may spread in a metapopulation over a complex landscape,
              ecological sustainability, social equity, and, ultimately, the
              reduction of infection prevalence in humans. With combined
              efforts from across the broad global health community, gene

              address different aspects of this important problem. However,
              these techniques are narrowly focused on particular biological
              and experimental platforms, and require experimental data that
              are typically unavailable and difficult to ascertain. The more

  abstract = "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) afflicts over 60 million people
              worldwide and leads to severe pathological outcomes in chronic
              cases. The nematode parasites (Nematoda: Filarioidea) that cause
              LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and
              mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion
              and migration of filarial worms through host tissues are complex
              and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors
              and signaling pathways that mediate directed migration in these
              medically important species. In order to better understand the
              role of chemosensory signaling in filarial worm taxis, we employ
              comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and
              chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor
              proteins and perturb chemotaxis phenotypes in filarial worms. We
              find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the
              presence of environmental (extrahost) stages in nematode life
              cycles, and that filarial worms contain compact and highly
              diverged chemoreceptor complements and lineage-specific ion
              channels that are predicted to operate downstream of
              chemoreceptor activation. In Brugia malayi, an etiological agent
              of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct
              parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate
              the role of chemosensation in the migration of larval worms,
              arthropod and mammalian infectious stage Brugia parasites were
              incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient
              receptor potential (TRP) channel OSM-9. Exposure of microfilariae
              to nicotinamide alters intramosquito migration, and exposure of
              L3s reduces chemotaxis toward host-associated cues in vitro.
              Nicotinamide also potently modulates thermosensory responses in
              L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for Brugia osm-9.
              Reverse genetic studies implicate both Brugia osm-9 and the
              cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel subunit tax-4 in larval
              chemotaxis toward host serum, and these ion channel subunits
              partially rescue sensory defects in Caenorhabditis elegans osm-9
              and tax-4 knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic
              and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins

              exclusively on a single drug. The neuromuscular system of
              schistosomes is fertile ground for therapeutic intervention, yet

              Tyr-Ile-Arg-Phe-amide (YIRFamide) contracts the muscle fibers

              elegans and four QTL in C. briggsae associated with divergent

              free-living Caenorhabditis elegans as no GARs have been
              characterized from parasitic species. Here we clone a putative
              GAR from the pig gastrointestinal nematode Ascaris suum with high
              structural homology to the C. elegans receptor GAR-1. Our GPCR,
              dubbed AsGAR-1, is alternatively spliced and expressed in the
              head and tail of adult worms but not in dorsal or ventral body
              wall muscle, or the ovijector. ACh activated AsGAR-1 in a

              agonists carbachol, arecoline, oxotremorine M and bethanechol

              AsGAR-1 activation by ACh was partially antagonized by the

              largely ineffective. Certain biogenic amine GPCR antagonists were
              also found to block AsGAR-1. Our conclusion is that Ascaris
              possesses G protein-coupled ACh receptors that are homologous in
              structure to those present in C. elegans, and that although they
              have some sequence homology to vertebrate muscarinic receptors,

              dispersal of one species through an association with a more
              mobile second species. Dauer larvae of the nematode
              Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit a phoretic behavior called
              nictation, which could enable interactions with animals such as
              isopods or snails. Here, we show that natural C. elegans isolates
              differ in nictation. We use quantitative behavioral assays and
              linkage mapping to identify a genetic locus (nict-1) that
              mediates the phoretic interaction with terrestrial isopods. The
              nict-1 locus contains a Piwi-interacting small RNA (piRNA)
              cluster; we observe that the Piwi Argonaute PRG-1 is involved in
              the regulation of nictation. Additionally, this locus underlies a
              trade-off between offspring production and dispersal. Variation
              in the nict-1 locus contributes directly to differences in

               While PZQ paralyses and kills parasitic schistosomes, in

              pathogenic mechanism involving the aggregation and deposition of
              misfolded proteins. Recently, it was shown that these aggregated
              proteins could be transferred from one cell to another via
              extracellular nanovesicles called exosomes. Initially thought to
              be a means of cellular waste removal, exosomes have since been
              discovered to actively participate in cell-to-cell communication.
              Importantly, various inflammatory and signaling molecules, as
              well as small RNAs are selectively packaged in these vesicles.
              Considering the important role of environmental manganese (Mn) in
              Parkinson's disease (PD)-like neurological disorders, we
              characterized the effect of Mn on exosome content and release
              using an MN9D dopaminergic cell model of PD, which was generated
              to stably express wild-type human $\alpha$-synuclein
              ($\alpha$Syn). Mn exposure (300$\mu$M MnCl2) for 24h induced the
              release of exosomes into the extracellular media prior to
              cytotoxicity, as determined by NanoSight particle analysis and
              electron microscopy. Strikingly, Western blot analysis revealed
              that Mn treatment in $\alpha$Syn-expressing cells increases the
              protein Rab27a, which regulates the release of exosomes from
              cells. Moreover, next-generation sequencing showed more small
              RNAs in exosomes isolated from Mn-exposed cells than from control
              exosomes. Our miRNA profiling analysis led to the discovery of
              increased expression of certain miRNAs previously shown to
              regulate key biological pathways, including protein aggregation,
              autophagy, inflammation and hypoxia. Collectively, our results
              provide a glimpse of Mn's role in modulating extracellular miRNA
              content through exosomal release from dopaminergic neuronal cells
              and thus potentially contributing to progressive
              neurodegeneration. Further characterization of extracellular
              miRNAs and their targets will have major impacts on biomarker

              precursors from 10 flatworm species. Most of these (51 predicted

               resulting in the loss of 14 million disability-adjusted life
               years per annum. Although these parasites cause significant
               mortality, they primarily cause chronic morbidity through a wide
               range of severe clinical ailments. Treatment options for
               nematode infections are restricted to a small number of

              host, both mosquito and human, during infection, development and
              persistence is dynamic and delicately balanced. Manipulation of
              this interface to the detriment of the parasite is a promising
              potential avenue to develop disease therapies but is prevented by

              Exosomes are bioactive small vesicles (30-120 nm) secreted by a
              wide range of cell types and involved in a wide range of
              physiological processes. Here, we report the identification and
              partial characterization of exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) released
              from the infective L3 stage of the human filarial parasite Brugia
              malayi. Exosome-like vesicles were isolated from parasites in
              culture media and electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking
              analysis were used to confirm that vesicles produced by juvenile
              B. malayi are exosome-like based on size and morphology. We show
              that loss of parasite viability correlates with a time-dependent
              decay in vesicle size specificity and rate of release. The
              protein cargo of these vesicles is shown to include common
              exosomal protein markers and putative effector proteins. These
              Brugia-derived vesicles contain small RNA species that include
              microRNAs with host homology, suggesting a potential role in host
              manipulation. Confocal microscopy shows J774A.1, a murine
              macrophage cell line, internalize purified ELVs, and we
              demonstrate that these ELVs effectively stimulate a classically
              activated macrophage phenotype in J774A.1. To our knowledge, this
              is the first report of exosome-like vesicle release by a human
              parasitic nematode and our data suggest a novel mechanism by
              which human parasitic nematodes may actively direct the host
              responses to infection. Further interrogation of the makeup and

              the largest groupings of eukaryotic proteins, and represent a
              particularly lucrative set of pharmaceutical targets. They play
              an important role in eukaryotic signal transduction and
              physiology, mediating cellular responses to a diverse range of
              extracellular stimuli. The phylum Platyhelminthes is of
              considerable medical and biological importance, housing major
              pathogens as well as established model organisms. The recent
              availability of genomic data for the human blood fluke
              Schistosoma mansoni and the model planarian Schmidtea
              mediterranea paves the way for the first comprehensive effort to
              identify and analyze GPCRs in this important phylum. RESULTS:
              Application of a novel transmembrane-oriented approach to
              receptor mining led to the discovery of 117 S. mansoni GPCRs,
              representing all of the major families; 105 Rhodopsin, 2
              Glutamate, 3 Adhesion, 2 Secretin and 5 Frizzled. Similarly, 418
              Rhodopsin, 9 Glutamate, 21 Adhesion, 1 Secretin and 11 Frizzled
              S. mediterranea receptors were identified. Among these, we report
              the identification of novel receptor groupings, including a large
              and highly-diverged Platyhelminth-specific Rhodopsin subfamily, a
              planarian-specific Adhesion-like family, and atypical
              Glutamate-like receptors. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out
              following extensive gene curation. Support vector machines (SVMs)
              were trained and used for ligand-based classification of
              full-length Rhodopsin GPCRs, complementing phylogenetic and
              homology-based classification. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide
              investigation of GPCRs in two platyhelminth genomes reveals an
              extensive and complex receptor signaling repertoire with many
              unique features. This work provides important sequence and

              cause debilitating chronic infections of humans and animals,
              decimate crop production and are a major impediment to
              socioeconomic development. Here we report a broad comparative
              study of 81 genomes of parasitic and non-parasitic worms. We have
              identified gene family births and hundreds of expanded gene
              families at key nodes in the phylogeny that are relevant to
              parasitism. Examples include gene families that modulate host
              immune responses, enable parasite migration though host tissues
              or allow the parasite to feed. We reveal extensive
              lineage-specific differences in core metabolism and protein
              families historically targeted for drug development. From an in
              silico screen, we have identified and prioritized new potential
              drug targets and compounds for testing. This comparative genomics

              countries. Here we present analysis of the 363 megabase nuclear
              genome of the blood fluke. It encodes at least 11,809 genes, with
              an unusual intron size distribution, and new families of
              micro-exon genes that undergo frequent alternative splicing. As
              the first sequenced flatworm, and a representative of the
              Lophotrochozoa, it offers insights into early events in the
              evolution of the animals, including the development of a body
              pattern with bilateral symmetry, and the development of tissues
              into organs. Our analysis has been informed by the need to find
              new drug targets. The deficits in lipid metabolism that make
              schistosomes dependent on the host are revealed, and the
              identification of membrane receptors, ion channels and more than
              300 proteases provide new insights into the biology of the life
              cycle and new targets. Bioinformatics approaches have identified
              metabolic chokepoints, and a chemogenomic screen has pinpointed
              schistosome proteins for which existing drugs may be active. The
              information generated provides an invaluable resource for the
              research community to develop much needed new control tools for

  abstract = "Nematode chemosensory behaviors underlie fundamental processes
              and activities in development, reproduction, tropisms and taxes.
              For parasitic species, chemosensation is essential for host
              seeking and host and tissue invasion behaviors. Such fundamental
              biology presents an attractive target for developing
              behavior-blocking anthelminthic drugs, but the anatomy and
              functional relevance of parasitic nematode chemosensory machinery
              are poorly understood. The goals of this study were to better
              understand the chemosensory apparatus and behaviors of infectious
              stage Brugia malayi (Spirurida: Onchocercidae), a mosquito-borne
              nematode and etiological agent of Lymphatic Filariasis. Scanning
              electron microscopy revealed that amphids, the major chemosensory
              organs, are present on adult B. malayi and arranged in a
              conserved manner. Internal sensory neuroanatomy display
              structural differences between life stages, and a simpler
              chemosensory architecture as compared to free-living nematodes.
              Positive and negative chemotactic behaviors were identified for a
              repertoire of chemicals with known chemostimulatory activity for
              the mosquito host that may facilitate host-selectivity and
              invasion. This is the first description of chemosensory anatomy
              and chemotactic behaviors in B. malayi that reveal the
              involvement of chemosensation in parasite transmission and host
              invasion.",
