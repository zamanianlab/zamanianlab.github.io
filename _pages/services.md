<code>Antiparasitic screening</code> We offer a range of powerful antiparasitic and anthelmintic screening assays using phenotyping pipelines and AI-assisted software developed in our laboratory. We offer in vitro screening assays for insect and soil-transmitted helminths of veterinary, agricultural, and human health relevance, as well as the model nematode *C. elegans*. Our platforms are scalable and provide quantitative multivariate readouts of drug action and kinetics. The deliverables for each assay will include an overview of QC data and processing of image data into informatives plots. All raw data will be retained for a year post delivery.

<code>Antiparasitic target assays</code> We offer additional services to help identify antiparasitic targets and guide structure-activity relationship studies, including procurement or creation of transgenic *C. elegans* strains for comparative phenotypic screening, forward genetic screens to identify mutations that alter drug responses, production of tissues for drug target engagement assays, and other customized deliverables. 

<code>Assay pricing</code> Contact us for assay menus and pricing. Pricing will depend on the method of parasite rearing or procurement, the format of drugs or chemicals provided, or other custom modifications of core pipelines.

In vitro assays:
- Filarial parasites: Dog heartworm (mf, L3, and L4), Brugia (adult males and females) 
- Gastrointestinal nematodes: *Haemonchus contortus* (larval assasys)
- Model nematodes: *C. elegans*

We expect to have pipelines for in vivo anthelmintic efficacy and in vitro ectoparasiticide testing within the next year.
